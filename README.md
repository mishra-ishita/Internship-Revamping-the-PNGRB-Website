The PNGRB website serves as a crucial platform providing regulatory information, reports, and compliance data about India’s oil and gas sector. Therefore, the redesign aimed to **modernize the interface**, **improve functionality**, and **present data in a clear, user-friendly manner**.


## Objectives
- Improve **usability and navigation** for diverse user groups — including government officials, industry professionals, and the general public.  
- Enhance **information accessibility** and readability for content-heavy sections.  
- Align the design with **modern web design principles and accessibility standards**.  
- Establish a **consistent visual identity** that reflects professionalism and trust.  


## Problem Statement
The existing PNGRB website, while functional, faced several usability and design challenges:
- A **non-intuitive navigation structure** that made information retrieval difficult.  
- **Outdated visual design** lacking cohesion and modern appeal.  
- **Content-heavy pages** with limited focus on readability and hierarchy.  
- **Low engagement** due to poor layout and unclear information flow.

1. **User Research & Analysis:**  
   Identified key user groups, their goals, and pain points through heuristic evaluation and competitive analysis.  

2. **Information Architecture Redesign:**  
   Reorganized site structure and created a logical navigation flow to simplify access to reports, data, and regulatory information.  

3. **Wireframing & Prototyping:**  
   Developed low- and high-fidelity prototypes focusing on clarity, accessibility, and responsive design.  

4. **Visual Design:**
